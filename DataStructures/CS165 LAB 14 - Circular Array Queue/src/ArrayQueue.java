/**
 * ArrayQueue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure that stores its elements
 * in an array (or something like it, like an {@link java.util.ArrayList}).
 * <p>
 * Can we use an {@link java.util.ArrayList} to directly represent a queue? A FIFO needs to push on one end,
 * and pop from the other. The tail of an {@link java.util.ArrayList} can support pop and push efficiently,
 * but the front supports neither efficiently.
 * <p>
 * Instead, we use an array for storage, and we represent the head and tail of the queue
 * with indices into that array. When one of the indices would fall off the end of the array,
 * it just goes back to the start of the array. That is why this pattern is called a "circular"
 * array. Read more about that <a href=../queue.html>here</a>.
 * <p>
 * We can think of the head and tail indices "chasing" each other around the circular
 * storage. When you add an item, the tail moves. When you take an item, the head moves.
 * If the head catches the tail, the queue is empty. If the tail catches the head, the queue is full.
 * <p>
 * That's a lot to take in, but it's easier to code than it sounds. Notice that the member variables
 * "removed" and "added" are counters recording the <i>total</i> operation count. To see where the head and
 * tail of the queue are, just compute:
 * {@code (removed % elements.length)} or {@code (added % elements.length)}
 * <p>
