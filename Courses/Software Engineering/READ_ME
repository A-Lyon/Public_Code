This code is a collection of files that I wrote for the cs314 class, Software Engineering. 

In the folder "Example of plan to usable code" I set aside a few javascript files that I wrote. I also included the original drawing that I used to plan out the function of the application that I was in charge of implementing. This function took a button click in our applications API to load a menu. From this menu the user could type a filename and select an extension, and then click a save/cancel button to save the file to their computer. All of this was completed using JS and react hooks. It is an example of my coding strategy, wherein I spend a good amount of time drawing out the functionality that I am needing, planning out the parts of that function, converting that plan into pseudo-code, and then letting that pseudo-code write itself into usable lines of organized code. 

There is a much larger code base from this class, that was produced by my teammates. We used the Scrum method to stay on track, stay accountable, and regularly meet to discuss the needs and accomplishments of each team member. This group had four students in it, and we were tasked with producing a web application that was able to plan trips to searchable locations, similar to google maps. There were a plethora of different functions that our application was able to do, but I did not want to share a bunch of code that my teammates had produced. The main take-away is that we worked together and seperately to accomplish goals that were set by the instructor. At the end of each 2-week scrum period, we were also required to demo our application to a mock-client. These were usually other professors or graduate students, who would ask us questions about the development process and test the functionality of our product.
