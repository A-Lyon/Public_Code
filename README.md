Code for job applications

This repository contains files written by me, that is available for review. These files will be in many programming languages. Files include different data structure implementations and test files for them mostly in java, unity projects written in C#, and some algorithms/ML files written in python. 

You are welcome to review, but not download or copy the code from any of these files.

Thank you for your interest.
